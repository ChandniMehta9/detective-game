<h2> Introduction </h2>

 This Python code takes the user through a game-like interface. The storyline has been created to portray the user as an agent, who must solve a combination of riddles and questions to crack the secret code hidden within the messages and complete the mission. 
The game navigates the user through various levels, each one contains the above mentioned riddles, that once solved, discloses a clue that will eventually combine with the rest to reveal the code and complete the gameâ€™s intended mission. As the user passes through each level, a map, made by the Turtle module, will indicate where you are presently located.
Each level offers only 3 tries to answer the questions accurately, after which the game terminates.
